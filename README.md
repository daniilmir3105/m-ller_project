## Conclusion
Summing up, it must be said that the programs used for high-precision calculations in the financial and economic environment were not 
created in the COBOL language for nothing. 
Python (and neither Java) has built-in support for fixed-point numbers. 
COBOL does have this support. If you need a program or algorithm for high-precision computing, 
then there is still nothing better than COBOL.
